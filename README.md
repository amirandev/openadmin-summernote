## Installation

Run the following command to install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require amirandev/open-admin-summernote
```

Then publish the package assets:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=open-admin-summernote
```

---

## Configuration

In your `config/admin.php` file, add the `summernote` extension configuration under the `extensions` section:

```php
'extensions' => [

    'summernote' => [

        // Set to false to disable this extension
        'enable' => true,

        // Editor configuration options
        'config' => [

            // See Summernote docs for available options
        ],
    ],

],
```

Example configuration (customize as needed):

```php
'config' => [
    'language'    => 'de',
    'height'      => 500,
    'contentsCss' => '/css/frontend-body-content.css',
]
```

For more configuration options, see the official [Summernote Documentation](https://summernote.org/deep-dive/#configuration).

## Usage

Use the Summernote editor in your OpenAdmin form like this:

```php
$form->summernote('content');
```

Or with custom options:

```php
$form->summernote('content')->options([
    'lang'        => 'fr',
    'height'      => 500,
    'contentsCss' => '/css/frontend-body-content.css',
]);
```

## Troubleshooting

If Summernote does not load or you see errors about missing files, try clearing your application cache:

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```
